NAME

    trbitmap - show bitmap with transparent background

SYNOPSIS

    trbitmap [ -ontop ] bitmap-file

DESCRIPTION

    Show bitmap on your desktop with transparent background.  It assumes
    color of lower left corner (0, 0) as background color, and pixels
    having same color as background.  As result, picture other than
    background color will appear on your desktop.  If you given "-ontop"
    option, then picture is displayed always on top of the desktop.  But
    it causes some trouble on screen lock.

    o Push Right Button         Raise Window
    o Push Left  Button         Show Menu
    o Drag with Left Button     Move Window

	        to draw frame appears.
    
    From menu, you can

        +-----+
        |Exit |         terminate Program
        +-----+

Warning

    This program consumes lot of system resources (CPU and memory), so
    if you want to use

        Large Bitmap
	Complex Bitmap
    
    system will slow down.  Practical limit will depend on your machine.
    So first try with small and simple bitmaps.
