NAME

    tranime - animate with several transparent bitmaps

SYNOPSIS

    tranime bitmap-file ...

DESCRIPTION

    Show animations with bitmap files specified in command line.
    
    When start this program, first control dialog appears.
    
        It takes lot time if you specified many/large bitmaps.

    Control dialog looks like below.

        +---+-----------------+---+ 
	|   |  Animate Bitmap |   |
        +---+-----------------+---+ 
	|       +---------------+ |
        | Step  |             20| |
	|       +---------------+ |

    where, set

        Step        next picture will placed 'step' pixels right.  If
                    step was minus, next picture will placed left side.
		    And also step was 0, picture will placed same
                    position.
        Delay       time in mili-sec between next picture.  If it was
                    too short, it requires lot of CPU cycle.

    and
    
        Run         start animation
	Stop        stop  animation
	Exit        terminate program

    Control dialog and animation have same Z-order.  If you place
    control dialog at top, animations also on top.  And if you select
    another window as top, animation moved below such windows.

Problems

    If 'step' was short, previous image remains a while.  If you known
    good method to avoid it without mashine load, ley me know.


Warning

    This program consumes lot of system resources (CPU and memory), so
    if you want to use

        Large Bitmap
	Complex Bitmap
    
    system will slow down.  Practical limit will depend on your machine.
    So first try with small and simple bitmaps.
